      <h3>Welcome to the Off Color Times!</h3>
      <p>Our mission is to provide reliable, (reasonably) objective, and up-to-date news that is relevant to off colors all across Homeworld, whether you're here in district 4-7, or all the way in district 2. Without further ado, allow me to introduce our small team:</p>
      <div class="about-us">

              </ul>
            </td>
            <td>I am Blue Emerald, and I am the official founder and head of the press, though it was really a group effort. I try to keep things semi-organized, and I'll write any articles that don't fit in either other writer's domain. I am also a film critic.</td>

              </ul>
            </td>
            <td>Maxixe is in charge of writing about any and all off color-focused social events. She might seem cheerful, but when she's on the job, she is deadly serious, flying above everyone else with her six wings.</td>

            <td>Tigers Eye goes around interviewing political figures and affiliates, and also attends many political events. On top of this, she is also by far the most fashionable of our team, and always has the right form for the occasion.</td>

            </td>
            <td>Galena writes the political articles. Sometimes she gets a little carried away with both detail and interpretation, but the rest of us can usually reel her in. Key word: "usually".</td>

            </td>
            <td>Legrandite is the fusion of Tigers Eye and Galena. Though she doesn't exist very much, she is a crucial member of the team becuase this is how Tigers Eye tells Galena what she has learned. Sometimes, Legrandite even writes an article herself.</td>
