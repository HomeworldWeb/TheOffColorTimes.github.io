          <section>Since the beginning of Era Three, Steven Universe has taught Gems to accept and treat Off Colors as equals. Some wonder why, if this is the case, it is necessary to have an entire complex dedicated for Off Colors, much less Off Color exclusive events. Therefore, as one of the main purposes of this newspaper is to highlight said Off Color exclusive events, it is crucial to first assure our readers that there are sound reasons for these events to be exclusive, and that the hierarchy has not simply been reversed.</section>
          <section>
            <h4>Community</h4>
            Even if Off Colors are equal to other Gems, that doesn't mean we have much in common with them. Many Off Colors, depending largely on what way exactly they are Off Color, were either shattered shortly after forming and have only been reconstructed since the start of Era Three, or went into hiding. Even Off Colors who remained part of the empire likely had very different experiences from their peers. While Off Color integration is very important as well, Off Colors among other Gems may still be alienated, despite any good intentions. This is why Off Color exclusive events are important: To provide a space for Off Colors to meet each other and share their unique experiences, without the overbearing presence of the standard - and assumed to be ubiquitous - past.</section>

            <h4>Security</h4>
            The unfortunate truth is that despite all the work Steven has done, some Gems are still not comfortable around Off Colors. Though this usually doesn't escalate beyond awkward interactions, Off Colors deserve a space where they are guaranteed not to be alienated. Furthermore, Gem events that are not Off Color focused often revolve around the previously mentioned standard past, which most Off Colors would not only not be included in, but they would also risk discomforting other Gems if they shared their own past, which could lead to conflict. In an Off Color exclusive event, everyone knows that all of their experiences will have deviated from the norm, so there will be no expectation of anyone's past conforming to any standard.</section>
          <br>
          <section>Even once Off Colors are truly equal and integrated, Off Color events will still be valuable for maintaining communities built around shared experiences.</section>
