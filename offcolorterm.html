            <section>Unlike "allochroic" and "metavarietal", the term "Off Color" is not a new one, and more importantly, it was not created by those whom it would be used to describe. It was created by the Diamonds, originally to apply to only Gems who were not the color they were intended to be, but after discovering that there were other "defects" a Gem could have, it was broadened to include almost all of them. While labels like "allochroic" are specific and chosen by Gems whom they would apply to, "Off Color" was chosen by the literal opposites of whom it would apply to, with its definition being "any Gem who does not contribute to the empire in the way the Diamonds want her to."</section>
            <br>
            <section>With this context, it is not hard to understand why some "Off Colors" seek a new term with which to identify. Others argue that since the dismantling of the Empire, there is no reason to maintain a system of categorization that differentiates Gems based on how well they were able to fulfill the Diamonds' wishes in past Eras. However, many Gems say that "Off Color" must be given a positive conotation, or unaccepting Gems will use it to further exclude and victimize the community.</section>

            <section>Though we recognize the validity of all these arguments, this newspaper will use the term "Off Color" until further notice, as it is, for better or for worse, still a practical distinction to make among Gems. If a new term is created to replace it, and that term becomes popular among those currently known as Off Colors, we will gladly use it instead. </section>
