          <section>We've already told you about how not all Gems have a good understanding of Off Colors, but now the Off Color Center is going to do something about it! That something is hosting On Color Cycle, an event with many panel discussions that are targeted towards non-Off Color Gems, here being humorously called On Colors. There will also be a movie showing and a mixer. Here is the schedule for the cycle, and a brief description of each event:/section>
          <section>
            <h4>Opening Remarks, .1 cycles, front hall</h4>
            Even if Off Colors are equal to other Gems, that doesn't mean we have much in common with them. Many Off Colors, depending largely on what way exactly they are Off Color, were either shattered shortly after forming and have only been reconstructed since the start of Era Three, or went into hiding. Even Off Colors who remained part of the empire likely had very different experiences from their peers. While Off Color integration is very important as well, Off Colors among other Gems may still be alienated, despite any good intentions. This is why Off Color exclusive events are important: To provide a space for Off Colors to meet each other and share their unique experiences, without the overbearing presence of the standard - and assumed to be ubiquitous - past.</section>

            <h4>Security</h4>
            The unfortunate truth is that despite all the work Steven has done, some Gems are still not comfortable around Off Colors. Though this usually doesn't escalate beyond awkward interactions, Off Colors deserve a space where they are guaranteed not to be alienated. Furthermore, Gem events that are not Off Color focused often revolve around the previously mentioned standard past, which most Off Colors would not only not be included in, but they would also risk discomforting other Gems if they shared their own past, which could lead to conflict. In an Off Color exclusive event, everyone knows that all of their experiences will have deviated from the norm, so there will be no expectation of anyone's past conforming to any standard.</section>

          <section>Even once Off Colors are truly equal and integrated, Off Color events will still be valuable for maintaining communities built around shared experiences.</section>
