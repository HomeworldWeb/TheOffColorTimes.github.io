          <section>After thousands of revolutions of the Diamond Authority, it can take some time to get used to the fact that we now get to choose our own leaders. Even after you get used to the fact of it though, you still might be wondering how it all works. And, if you're an Off Color, what's your stake in it?</section>
          <section>
            <h4>Elections</h4>
            First of all, the holder of each position is determined by voting. For a single position, each candidate must receive more than half of the votes from her region to win, so if there are more than two candidates in an election and none of them recieve enough votes to win, any candidates who recieved less than a "fair share" of votes will be eliminated, and there will be another election. Each district will have a supervisor, elected by only that district, and each zone will have a supervising council of three Gems, elected by the whole zone. In these elections, the three candidates who receive the most votes in a single election will assume the positions, but if there are more than four candidates, only if each receives more than a quarter of the total votes. The High Council will consist of five Gems, each representing one of the five zones, and elected by only that zone. Finally, the presidential candidates must first receive the support of at least two fifths of each zone (in this vote, each Gem may support as many candidates as she wishes), and then win the Homeworld-wide election. </section>

            <h4>Governance</h4>
            District supervisors will deal with any problems that may arise in the district, oversee projects, and determine laws within the wider bounds. Zone supervising councils have similar duties, and both may appoint other willing Gems to oversee some of them, and report situations that may have implications outside of their jurisdaiction to the next higher level of government. The councils are expected to settle most disagreements by discussion, but may put matters to a vote among the three of them if they deem it necessary. The President will often act as the leader of the High Council, but in the law making process, the president must be the one to formally propose the law, and if at least three of the High Councilors support it, it will pass, after the Councilors who did not support it have a chance to explain why, and the President is able to revise the proposed law based on the objections, if she wishes to. If the revisions result in other Councilors not supporting the law, it will be voted on again. Similarly, if less than three High Councilors support the law, the president may revise it and re-propose it.</section>
          <section>
            <h4>Off Colors</h4>
            For Off Colors, there are a few rules to be aware of ahead of time when voting: fusions must unfuse so each component can vote individually to try to avoid undetectable voter influencing, and all Gems must state their facet and cut, to prevent Gems from voting more than once in an election. Though the window to register as a candidate has not closed, there is a dissapointingly small number of Off Colors who have already done so. A White Aquamarine is "running" for district 4-7 supervisor against a Yellow Agate, an allochroic Jade is running for district 3-4 supervisor against several other candidates, and an Off Color Moonstone is running in district 5-8, though other candidates have made more progress advertising their candidacy than she has. So far only one Off Color has announced her candidacy for any higher position, and that is a Pink Hessonite for zone 4 High Council representative. However, she has advertised her campaign mostly around keeping humans from "taking over" Homeworld, which is not aligned with the views of most Off Colors. Hopefully this article has been helpful, and I will continue to provide updates as events continue.
